## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  - Vehicle weight, Spoiler Angle and AWD are the variables providing non-random amount of variance.
  -No, the slope of our linear regression is not considered to be Zero. From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 70% of all predictions will be correct when using this linear model. The p-value is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Hence, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
 - According to the calculated r squared value, the linear model has 70% chance of predicting the correct outcome, i.e, mpg of MechaCar Prototypes effectively. There might be other unknown variables involved in the outcome.
