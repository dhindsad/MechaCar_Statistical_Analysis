## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  - Vehicle weight, Spoiler Angle and AWD are the variables providing non-random amount of variance.
  -No, the slope of our linear regression is not considered to be Zero. From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 70% of all predictions will be correct when using this linear model. The p-value is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Hence, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
 - According to the calculated r squared value, the linear model has 70% chance of predicting the correct outcome, i.e, mpg of MechaCar Prototypes effectively. There might be other unknown variables involved in the outcome.

The current manufacturing data meet does not design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually as the variance is for lot 3 is way more than lot 1 and 2.
